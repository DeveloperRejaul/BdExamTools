We wished that we could put everything in the dream list in the next App from Getsells, but realistically, there was so much content and technological development right from the outset that we were forced to make choices.  So, here are some of our considerations.

Get something out to market that works with a reasonable time frame and app structure but is highly scalable.

Use technology to help, but look realistically at the constraints.

Create Artificial Intelligence content that is made for Android and iOS from the Getsells.

Getsells Thought is an organization dedicated to innovation in Programming & education through the growth of outstanding Developers.
